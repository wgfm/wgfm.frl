Hi, I'm Werner, and welcome to my blog! I am a software engineer,
professionally writing Go for [bol.com](https://www.bol.com). I've been writing
code since I was 8 years old, and even though the code I wrote back then wasn't
exactly production ready, I've picked up a couple of bits of knowledge since.

I have the privilege to be the husband of my lovely wife, and father of our
amazing daughter. They mean the world to me, and this About would not be
complete without them.

I also write music for and play guitars in my black metal band,
[Kjeld](https://kjeld.frl/). You can find us on Spotify and Apple Music, and
perhaps we'll be performing in a venue in your neighborhood someday.
